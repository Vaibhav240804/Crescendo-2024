But not too bad.3) Taste: Tastes like some ayurvedic recipe. Not bad.4) Ingredients: Has many natural ingredients and minimal chemicals compared to other pastes.5) Price: The 3+1 combos are so much cheaper than the single ones. There are 100g, 150g, 200g variants in 3+1 combos, so check whichever you can afford and whichever is on biggger discount.Overall: Holygrail toothpaste. Would repurchase till I find a better cheaper alternative.",
